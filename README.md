## This project introduces you to the `raycasting`, a rendering technique to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map popularized by ID Software in 1992 with the famous game : *Wolfenstein 3D* üî´üí™.

We can divide this project in four parts : the **parsing**, the **DDA algorithm**, **graphic implementation** and the **keys detetction**.

## 1. The Parsing üî®
- <ins>The argument</ins> üí≠
only one argument must be given after the executable file : **a VALID map file with a `.cub` extension**
```
./cub3D [VALID_MAP]
```

- <ins>The textures</ins> üé®
Four texture files must be specified in the map file, by their `path` and in **`.xpm` format**. One texture per line with a prefix specifying its orientation : **north `NO`**, **south `SO`**, **west `WE`** and **east `EA`**. **Floor `F`** and **ceiling `C`** aren't textures, but in `RGB` color format.

- <ins>The map</ins> üó∫Ô∏è
The map has 3 types of entity represented by a character : `1` is a **wall**, `0` a **free space** where the player can move in, and `N/S/W/E` is the **player with his spawning orientation**.
The map cannot be loaded if the map isn't closed, or a `whitespace` is inside it, or even an invalid character is present in the file.

## 2. The DDA algorithm üßÆ
Or the **Digital Differential Analyzer** is a simple and efficient method used for rasterization of lines in computer graphics. It calculates the intermediate points of a straight line between two given endpoints and plots those points to draw the line on the screen.
In our case, a fixed value `W_WIDTH` define the width of our windows. This value leads us to define our `FOV`. The `FOV` is arbitrary, it is based on the **trigonometric circle**.

Let's skip the details, in the end we have this result, seen from above:

Dozens of rays/vectors are traced until the impact of a mus with the limit of the self-imposed FOV.
The last step for completing the raycasting is the graphic implementation, **succeed in making the links between calculations and textures**.

## 3. The graphic implementation ‚úçÔ∏è
Now, we have everything we need to simulate our 3D in a 2D screen.
We have to calculate the distance from the top of the screen to a wall, knowing this : `The farther we are from a wall, the less wall/ray collisions there are.
The less detail, the smaller the wall.
Finally, the less detailed the wall, the more floor and ceiling`.
Exemple :
![](./doc/raycasting.gif)

Pixels are always drawn from top to step (`+x` to `0`). Then we move on to the next value of y: **the next row of pixels** until we reach the limits of the window, <ins>calculations are always updated at every frame</ins>.

## 4. The movement and keys detection üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The function `mlx_hook` catches keys on the keyboard when *pressing* or *releasing* them, it's very simple to implement that to the movement of the player.
But this raw method is very low in-game : we **manipulate one octet** for fluid movements.
In our structure, a variable `uint8_t keys` is an empty `int` ( `00000000` ). Each byte represents a key, when the key is pressed, the byte turns `0` to `1`. This modification moves the player, and makes new calculations for the point of view ( `10000000` ). The movement stops when the `key` is released and the byte returns into zero ( `00000000` ).

### How to test our program üëæ

**First, open a `terminal` clone the repositorie and enter it** :
```
git clone git@github.com:Nimpoo/cub3d.git && cd cub3d
```

**Second, download maps, textures and minilibx with this command** :
```
make init
```
**Then you can run this to compile** :
```
make && ./cub3D maps/subject.cub
```
You can test other maps present in this directory : `./maps/` or even create your own map and add new textures üòÉ !

### Commands
You can control the **crying child** with `WASD keys`, move the **camera** with `RIGHT` and `LEFT` and quit the game with `ESC`.

---

You can remove binary and compiled files :
```
make fclean
```
If you want, you can clean the directory by removing all downloaded files :
```
make fclean_init
```
